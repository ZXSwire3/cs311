COPY using cp -r as specified in the Given Before Semester sheet!
  These directories are to be COPIED to your account.

  Demo Programs should be studied and tested on empress
  in your own account AFTER you have copied the files. 

  Although you are only required to compile and run programs
  on empress, you should try editing programs using emacs.
  Learning to use UNIX is very important for future classesand getting jobs! 

  Do all work within the HWPrograms directory so that it is easy
  to copy necesary files between assignments.

  You may download all the files using SFTclient 
  if you wish.

Note that you can always do 
   more  filename
to display files one screen at a time.

Study the help files on the COMPILER and UNIX right now and practice!!!!
