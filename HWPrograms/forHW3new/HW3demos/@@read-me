Try
  compiling and running each with a linked list that does
  not have copy constructor and overloading yet. 
  (rlist.o is just like llist.cpp but you cannot see it)

  See what happens and record the results on the HW sheet.
  i.e. what type of errors did you get and why?  Do not copy the output.

  g++ equalstest.cpp rlist.o
  g++ getstest.cpp rlist.o
  g++ copyconsttest.cpp rlist.o
