  NEVER NEVER delete my comments. Leave them in there!!!!
  1. Make sure your functions are reusable with other clients
  2. Do not repeat the same code all over the same file
  3. Throw in functions, catch in client
  4. Test very very thoroughly to make sure there are no errors
  5. Must submit all required files or you will get no points

 And most importatly, finish submitting at least an hour before
 the cut off.
