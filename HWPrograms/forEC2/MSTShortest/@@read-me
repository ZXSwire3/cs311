EC2 Graphs (after HW8 has been completed)

These files must be used for extra credit graph algorithm programs.
- copy the list files from Hash forHW8/ 
- run my .out solutions to learn what the output should be
- read elem.cpp carefully
- complete dgraph2.cpp
- test using my clients

Input file are utable.txt and dtable.txt
  utable.txt == undirected graph for MST
  dtable.txt == directed graph for Shortest

Try testing with other input files, too.

--- Note that HW7's EC (Detect Cycle) is also part of EC2 ------
