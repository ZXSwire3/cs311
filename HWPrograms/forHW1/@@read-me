HW1 INSTRUCTIONS

  HW1 assignments are reviews of CS211 concepts.
  That is why we move very fast through them!

  First, read the assignment sheet throughly.

  Always run my demo programs first.
  To make sure they are executable,
  chmod u+x *.out
  then do
  ./<name of prog>.out

  Always read @@readme in each sub-folder.

  Always read .h to determine what functions are in .cpp.

  Complete .h and .cpp files. Always look for **.

  Test with my test.cpp files but never change them!
 [ Study my test programs to learn how to write
   test programs in the future!   ]
